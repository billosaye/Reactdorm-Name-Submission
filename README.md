# React Name Submission App2

This is a simple React application that captures user input and displays a greeting message with the inputted name upon form submission.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main files:

- **App.js**: Contains the main application logic, including form handling and state management.
- **index.js**: Responsible for rendering the `App` component to the DOM.

## Features

- **User Input Handling**: The application allows users to input their first name, last name, and county, which are stored in the component's state.
- **Form Submission**: Upon clicking the submit button, the entered name and county are displayed in a personalized greeting message on the screen.
- **State Management**: The application uses React's `useState` hook to manage the input values and the displayed greeting.
